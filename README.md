# esp32-c--tests
Tests using static templates and lambdas running on Esp32

Tests done with platformio under arduino-framework. 
Espressif esp-idf should work just as fine but arduino is been much faster for development as it grabs
 an already compiled version of the esp idf sdk components.

QueueCreateStatic didn't work for this setup but it should for esp idf.
